You hold in your hands the key to a world of happiness, the finest guitar 
instruction material you will ever see. Guitar Juggling achieves the 
conflicting goals of teaching you enough music theory to understand what is 
going on while not confusing or boring you with stuff you will never use. These 
lessons are packed with content yet distilled to their essence. Here is the 
educational equivalent of a high end sports car, the Maserati of music education, 
able to take you from zero to 100mph in a little over two seconds. You hold the 
keys. Go for it. Now. Floor it.
